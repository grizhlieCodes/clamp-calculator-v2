# Clamp Calculator - V2

[Tool link](https://grizhlie-clamp-calculator-v2.netlify.app)

I wanted to build some simple tool that helps you build things quicker when
using the CSS clamp property. 

This tool allows you to:
- Select what CSS tech you're working with. After all, CSS is written
  differently with vanilla or TailwindCSS. 
- Retain the clamps you created (local storage)
- Has a dark-mode, because why not.
- Copy/remove a single clamp or copy/remove all clamps you have saved.

Bugs:
- Currently the main bug is infuriating: if you scroll down and click 'Add Clamp
  +', you are automatically scrolled to the very top. No clue what that's about.
  I've been attempting to recreate this bug else where, so far I have failed.
